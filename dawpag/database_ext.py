        Note that this method is called for all instances that are marked as

        collections are modified. If, at update time, no column-based attributes
        have any net changes, no UPDATE statement will be issued. This means
        that an instance being sent to before_update is not a guarantee that an
        UPDATE statement will be issued (although you can affect the outcome
        here).

        To detect if the column-based attributes on the object have net changes,
